# 3.0 RETRIEVING INFORMATION ABOUT MAP FEATURES

The features in a project file have more than just a shape and a location.  In TownSuite Mapping, map features are linked to non-spatial information, or attributes, that is stored in tables.  This section outlines how to display data in TownSuite and retrieve information about map features.

## 3.1 DISPLAY ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION

### 3.1.1 Shape Information

The Shape Information tool  ![Information tool](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Shape Information.png){:class="inlineimage"} is perhaps the fastest way to get information about a single map feature

- Highlight the layer in the Map Legend

- Activate the tool in the main toolbar

- Click on any feature in the map. The Shape Information window will appear displaying the attributes of the feature as seen in Figure 3.1.

![Figure 3.1](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Figure 3.1.png)
 **Figure 3.1** -Shape Information dialog box

## 3.1.2 Show Attributes of the Selected Layer

The Show Attributes of the Selected Layer tool ![Selected Layer tool ](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Show Attributes o f selected layer.png){:class="inlineimage"} will open a new window, which lists the attributes of all the features in a layer.

 - First, highlight the desired layer in the Map Legend.

 - Activate the Show Attributes of the Selected Layer tool to open the Layer Attributes table (see figure 3.2).


![Figure 3.2](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Figure 3.2.png)
**Figure 3.2** : Layer Attributes Table


>**What do the columns and rows in the Layer Attribute table represent?**
>
>*The Layer Attribute table contains a record (row) for each feature in the layer, and a field or attribute (column) for each category of information. For example, there may be 7000 records (rows) in the property layer, each record representing a parcel of land.  Each parcel has associated columns of attributes such as owner name, roll number, etc.*

### 3.1.3 Map Tips

Map Tips is a mouse over option used to temporarily display attribute information of map features.

- First, ensure that the Map Tips option is activated.

- Select the layer from the first dropdown list, and the attribute, or field, from the second dropdown list.

- Lastly, pause the cursor over the map feature and a text box will appear, displaying an attribute of that feature.

In figure 3.3, notice how the zone description “Rural Residential” appears when the cursor is held above the zone in the map

## 3.2 LINKED DOCUMENTS

Some information associated with map features cannot be stored as an attribute in a table.  Hot Links can be used to associate features with such information.  Examples of linked data can include survey plans, engineering drawings, development agreements, images, videos, **AutoCAD** drawings and spreadsheets, to name a few. Virtually any document can be linked to a feature in the map as long as your desktop has the necessary software to open the file extension.

The pathname of Hot Link files are stored in a field of the layers attribute table.  In order to access a file:

- Select the layer in the Map Legend.

- Next select the name of the layer from the first Map Tips dropdown list.

- From the second dropdown list, select the field name that stores the pathname of the document.

- Finally, with the Hot Link tool ![Link tool](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Hot Link tool.png){:class="inlineimage"}  selected in the main toolbar • Click on the feature in the map to open the file.

Figure 3.4 displays an image of a Heritage Park. The path is stored in the LINK field, as seen in the Map Tip dropdown list.

![Figure 3.4](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Figure 3.4.png)

**Figure 3.4** : Photo of the a heritage park. The path to this photo is stored in the LINK field of the Heritage Park layer.

## 3.3 MEASURE

The Measure Menu contains four tools that allow the user to measure length and area of geographic features in the map. This option is useful when the dimensions of a feature are not recorded in the layer attributes, or when the user wishes to measure a custom distance or area in the map.

### 3.3.1 Measure Line

The Measure Line tool calculates the length of a user defined line or line segments.

- 	Click on the Measure Line tool from the Measure Menu.  The Measure Information dialog box appears.

-	Next, click the starting point of the line.

-	Then click elsewhere to complete the line segment. The tool will calculate the cumulative length of all line segments so there is no need to double click to complete the line.

-	To clear the dimensions, Click the Clear Shapes button on the Measure Information dialog box.

-	To measure another feature, click New Shape.

Figure 3.5 displays the measurements of the back of a parcel of land using the Measure Line option.

**Note**: There is also a Measure Line tool ![Measure Line tool ](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Measure Line tool.png){:class="inlineimage"} in the Main Toolbar for quick access.

![Figure 3.5](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Figure 3.5.png)
**Figure 3.5** : Line measurements using the Measure Line option.

### 3.3.2 Measure Polygon

The Measure Polygon tool calculates the area and perimeter of a user defined polygon.

-	Click on the Measure Polygon tool from the Measure Menu. The Measure Information dialog box appears.

-	Next, click the starting point of the polygon.

-	Then click elsewhere to complete each side of the polygon. The tool will calculate the cumulative area and perimeter of the polygon.

-	To clear the dimensions, click the Clear Shapes button on the Measure Information dialog box.

-	To measure another feature, click New Shape.

### 3.3.3 Measure Rectangle

The Measure Rectangle tool calculates the area and perimeter of a user defined rectangle.

-	Click on the Measure Rectangle tool from the Measure Menu. The Measure Information dialog box appears.

-	Next, click the starting point of the rectangle.

-	Then click drag and release to complete the rectangle.

-	To clear the dimensions, click the Clear Shapes button on the Measure Information dialog box.

-	To measure another feature, click New Shape.

### 3.3.4 Measure Circle

The Measure Circle tool calculates the area and circumference of a user defined circle.

-	Click on the Measure Circle tool from the Measure Menu. The Measure Information dialog box appears.

-	Next, click the center point of the circle then drag outward and release to complete the circle.

-	To clear the dimensions, click the Clear Shapes button on the Measure Information dialog box.

-	To measure another feature, click New Shape.

>**How can the units of measure be changed?**
>
>*The units of measure can be changed to miles, feet, inches, kilometers, meters, or centimeters by selecting the desired units of measure from the Units option in the Scale Menu.*

## 3.4 SPATIAL SELECTION

Spatial selection refers to selecting, or highlighting, a feature or a group of features in the map.  Spatial selection is one way to query a database to retrieve information related to selected features in the map. TownSuite Mapping has two tools that can be used to select map features.

### 3.4.1 Select Mode

The Select Mode tool ![Select Mode tool](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Select Mode tool.png){:class="inlineimage"} (introduced in section 2) is designed specifically for interacting with the properties layer and the Property Information Panel.  With the Select Mode tool activated, click on a parcel in the map to select it.  The program will then search the database for the property and return the data in the Property Information panel.  The selected parcel will appear highlighted as displayed in Figure 3.6.

![Figure 3.6](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Figure 3.6.png)

**Figure 3.6**: A parcel of land (from the Properties layer) selected with the Select Mode tool.

### 3.4.2 Select by Location

The Select by Location option (Figure 3.7) from the Selection Menu allows the user to select features based on their spatial relationship to other features.   For example, the user can select the fire hydrants that are within 200 meters of a building.  Or select the properties within a street block.

-	From the Select by Location dialog box, select the layer to perform the selection on from the Layers dropdown list.

-	Select the operation type from the Operation Type dropdown list.  Accept the default “Add to Selection” for new selections.

-	Select the feature to base the selection on (either a Shape Tool or Layer).

-	Define the spatial relationship by choosing a Selection Type.

![Figure 3.7](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Figure 3.7.png)
**Figure 3.7**: Select by Location dialog box.

The Shape Tool option allows the user to draw a shape in the map (either point, line, rectangle, polygon or circle) which will be used to select features that satisfy the defined spatial relationship with the shape (for example select the features from the property layer that intersect a polygon). The spatial relationship (between shape and feature) required for the selection is defined by the Selection Type.

There are 15 Selection Types to choose from.   The user can define any combination of shape and selection type to achieve the desired feature selection.

-	Click the Apply button then use the cursor to draw the shape in the map, if using the Shape Tool option, or select a feature, if using the Layer option. The Show Selection tab in the select by location dialog box displays the results of the selection in a tabular format.

>**Can’t complete the selection?**
>
>*Shape Tool - Double click to complete the shape and retrieve the selected features. The selected features will appear highlighted in the map and the results will be displayed in the Show Selections tab of the Location Selection dialog box.*
>
>*Layer - Use the cursor to draw a small polygon in the feature in order to choose the feature you want to base the spatial relation on. Double click to complete the polygon.*

The select by location tool can also be used to select features within a specified distance from a user defined shape.

-	Simply select the “Search within specified distance” Selection Type

-	Type the distance (in meters).

-	Click Apply to draw a shape in the map.

-	Double click to complete the shape and return the selected features.  Figure 3.8 displays a selection of all the properties that are within 200 meters of a property.

**Figure 3.8** : Selected parcels within a specified distance.


## 3.5 ATTRIBUTE SELECTION

Spatial selections are ideal when the location of a feature is known.  However, there are times when you may want to locate features that meet certain search criteria.  For example, select all the gravel roads in the municipality. This is called attribute selection.  TownSuite Mapping has several ways to query data by attribute information.

### 3.5.1 Property Information Search

The Property Information Panel can be used to search for and select a property in the map, simply by typing the desired search criteria in the appropriate text box, and clicking the Search button. If the search yields more than one result, the Total Records label at the bottom of the panel will display the number of records and the “Next” button will become active allowing the user to view the other records.  Be sure to press the Clear button before attempting a new search.

### 3.5.2 Datatable

Additional property information and documents associated with a parcel can be stored in a supplementary datatable.  The datatable can be accessed by enabling the selecting an option from the Viewing Options dropdown list in the Property Information panel (Figure 3.9).  Note that the datatable, located below the Map Display, is be populated with additional information for the selected property.

![Figure 3.9](https://ca.docs.townsuite.com/images/Mapping/Figure 3.9.png)
**Figure 3.9**: Viewing Options dropdown list in the Property Information Panel.

### 3.5.3 Select by Attributes

The Select By Attributes option in the Selection Menu allows the user to write queries that automatically select features that meet certain search criteria (for example, all the commercial lots in ward 2). A query is written in Structured Query Language (SQL) and consists of an attribute (such as “zone”), a value (such as “commercial”), and a relationship between them (such as “equal to”).  Operators such as “and” and “or” can be used to connect simple queries to form more complex queries. TownSuite Mapping has a query builder that allows the user to easily write queries by selecting attributes, values, and relationships from dropdown lists.

From the Select by Attributes dialog box Figure 3.10:

-	Select the layer to perform the selection on from the layer dropdown list.

-	Next, select the selection type from the Select Type dropdown list.

-	Accept the default “Add to Selection” for new selections.

-	In the Query Builder tab, select the attribute from the Layer Attributes list box.

-	Select the appropriate operator.

-	Select the value from the Sample Values list box.

>**Don’t see the required value in the Sample Values list box?**
>
>*The sample value list box may not contain all the available values for an attribute. To complete the query, simply type the value in the Query box (exactly as it is written in the database) in single quotations.Before applying the query, be sure to:*

-	Select the appropriate radio box in order to search the visible map extent or the full map extent (entire database).

-	Once the query is written, verify that the query does not contain any syntax errors by selecting the == Verify button==.

-	Once verified.

-	Click Apply to execute the query.

-	Click on the Query Results tab to view a table of the selected results.

The features will also be selected in the map for a visual representation of the feature location.

**Figure 3.10**: Select by Attribute dialog box.
**What do the different operators represent?**

| Symbol   |  Description          | Example		                          |
|--------  |-------------- |--------------------------------- |
|  =       | equal to      |eg. Zone  =  “Rural Residential”  |
| <>  	   | not equal to  |eg. Surface_Type  <>  “gravel”    |
| >  	   | greater than  |eg. Length  >  “100”              |
| <  	   | less than     |eg. Length  <  “500”              |
| >=  	   |greater than or equal to | eg. Year  >=  “1950”   |
| <=  	   |less than or equal to  	 | eg. Elevation  <=  “1500” |

### 3.5.4 Search Shape Attributes

The Search Shape Attributes text box, located below the Map Display can be used to quickly search for features in the map display.

-	Simply specify the search criteria by selecting the layer and field from the map tips dropdown lists.

-	Type the value in the text box.

-	Press enter to execute the search.

For example, in Figure 3.11, all zones of type RR (Rural Residential) are selected in the map by searching from the Zoning layer, for Zone of type RR.

**Figure 3.11**: Attribute Selection using the Search Shape Attributes option.

>**How are features deselected?**
>
>*The Deselect Tool in the main toolbar can be used to deselect features in the Map Display.  Note that the deselect tool will only deselect the features from the layer that is highlighted in the Map Legend. In order to deselect all features (from all layers), use the Deselect All option from the Selection Menu.*
